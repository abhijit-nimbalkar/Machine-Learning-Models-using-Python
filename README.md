# Machine-Learning-Models-using-Python
This repository contains all machine learning model that I have worked on.
I have worked on following machine learning algorithms- 
1) Random Forests 
2) Decision Tree 
3) Linear Regression
4) Logistic Regression 
5) Softmax regression 
6) Support Vector Machine 
7) Kernalized SVM 
8) Extra Randomized Tree
9) KMeans 
10) DBSCAN 
11) Gaussian Mixture Model 
12) Expectation Maximization
I have worked extensively on each algorithm with specific example and its visualization. I have also included the mathematics part of Machine Learning in all respective notebook files.
